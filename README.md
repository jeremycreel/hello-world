Repository for familiarization of the mechanics and settings of GitHub

My name is Jeremy Creel. I have a Bachelors Degree from Texas A&M University in Geology, and a Masters Degree from Texas A&M University in Geographic Information Science and Technology. To hone the skills I was exposed to during my Masters program I am going to play with Python programming and utilize tools such as GitHub to display these skills.
